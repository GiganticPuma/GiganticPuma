## About me👋 
Hi, I’m @GiganticPuma,
I'm currently working with C#, but I also worked with C/C++, Python, Java, JavaScript and Php! Programming is a lovley stuff to do you learn so many things about everthing!


## Programming 🤖
I started programming long time ago and my first programm was a basic Discord bot which reacted to messages in specific channels. The Programm was written in Python and took over 2,000 lines of code.
Methodes, Classes and so on was something I didn't know until there. Nowdays I love object-based code so C#, C++ and Java were the perfect languages for me. 

## Improving 🚀
When I work on projects I always want to improve myself to become better. It's important how you write your code!


## Datastorage 🗂️
When I store data in my programms I do it in a MySQL database (when it's a big deal) otherwise I use JSON or XML to store and restore my data.
